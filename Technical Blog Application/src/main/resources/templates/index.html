        <header th:replace="layout :: logged-out"></header><!--header is understood by thymeleaf but not by HTML
        replace keyword - helps in rendering dynamic content, replaces the given component of the web page with
         the referenced HTML component from another HTML file. here layout means sort of another HTML page which
         will come under templates.layout would contain the data regarding what should be in the header and footer
         and in the body while logged-out is a fragment or sort of key to tell thymeleaf that when you intercept
         "layout::logged-out" look for this content which is defined in other HTML files within thymeleaf templates
         and replace that content with this value.-->

        <h1>All Technical Blog Posts</h1>
        <!-- The code within the main tag helps you take the model from the controller, take the posts from
        the data stored in the model, iterate over the list of posts, and display them on the web page.-->
        <main id="posts"><!--main and post tags are not predefined HTML tags-->
            <post th:each="p : ${posts}" ><!--fields within the $ is a variable stored in a specific scope-->
                <!--The post tag is a dummy container and does not signify anything to HTML or Thymeleaf.
                This is just to make the code more readable.The code that really matters is th:each ="p: ${posts}".
                This instruction iterates over the list of posts received from HomeController.
                ${posts} represents the array list of posts stored under the 'posts' key in the model returned by
                the controller.-->

<!-- Thymeleaf will help you with the following:
Create views or dynamic websites:

Using Thymeleaf, you can take the model data returned by the controller class and render it in an HTML web page.

Set standard headers and footers to different web pages of your application. Thymeleaf will help reuse the HTML
code written for the headers and footers.

Thymeleaf will also provide you with a view resolver. It will take a view name from the controller and find the
appropriate view mapped to that name. You can read more about the view resolver provided by Thymeleaf in Section
3 of the official documentation here.-->
